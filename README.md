NodeJS module to calculate minimal cost paths given N points

# Authors
1. Andre Ricardo Cintra (USP)

# Proposal
Find shortest path given N points. Each point is an address and the costs between points are given by Google Maps API. Dijikstra's algorithm is the chosen one to be implemented (Reference 1).

# Objective
Publish a npm package so the JS developers community can easily include this in their projects under de MIT license.

# Motivation
Learn, increase and steady NodeJS knowledges and keep contact with famous and stable algorithms like Djikstra's shortest path.
